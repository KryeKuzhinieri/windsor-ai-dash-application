# Marketing Dash Application

Whenever we release a product to production we want people to consume the material presented such that profit is returned to the organization. A good way to introduce people to our projects is by using various ads platforms (Google Ads, Facebook Ads, Twitter Ads, TikTok Ads, etc.), however, the issue arises when we want to track all the data together. At times integration with one of the service providers becomes tricky causing difficulties to analyze the productâ€™s achievements. But it is not all bad! To the rescue comes [Windsor](windsor.ai) with its amazing services to integrate all platforms into a single API.
